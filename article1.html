The ethical status of vaccine mandates has become one of the most controversial issues in contemporary applied ethics. Often, the moment the topic is introduced, the air seems to leave the room; shoulders rise, and we are deep in political tribalism. This paper seeks to step outside these polarizing narratives to examine the fundamental ethical foundations of vaccine mandates. 
To do this, we must first strip away the empirical "noise" that usually fuels the fire. Rather than trying to dispute the medical data, I will assume that vaccines are:
highly effective, 
involve minimal risk, 
are supported by evidence so robust that rejecting these claims would be epistemically irrational. 
By granting these assumptions, the paper aims to show that the central ethical difficulties surrounding mandatory vaccination persist even under conditions maximally favorable to its proponents. 

I intend to show that the ethical case for mandates collapses for three primary reasons: results from their premises lead to conclusions that are inevitably absurd, are guilty of a consistency mistake or it would implicitly render features of the normal human biological condition morally impermissible.
My thesis, if correct, is noteworthy for two main reasons. Firstly, it suggests that the ethical case for mandates cannot be "saved" by more data or better statistics. Even if a hypothetical, %100 risk-free vaccine were available, any form of discrimination based on vaccination status remains unjustifiable. Secondly, such measures do more than infringe on fundamental freedoms; they undermine the intrinsic constitution of the human being. From this perspective, any potential health benefits associated with mandatory vaccination become secondary, and ultimately irrelevant.

Harming Others 
Many of the most influential arguments for mandatory vaccination are based on the idea of preventing harm to others (Savulescu, 2020). In this view, refusing vaccination is not merely a personal choice, but an action that imposes an unreasonable risk on other people. Similarly, Brennan argues that when individuals participate in activities that expose others to significant and avoidable risk, they violate others’ rights. According to Brennan, choosing not to be vaccinated creates a collective level of risk that is serious enough to count as a rights violation. From this perspective, individual freedom may justifiably be overridden, since large-scale refusal to vaccinate is said to make serious public health disasters inevitable (Brennan, 2016).
This line of reasoning seems to suggest that simply choosing not to get vaccinated is enough to create a disaster, while mandating vaccination for everyone would be enough to prevent it. It also implies that overriding people’s freedom would not itself produce a different kind of disaster. Yet the harm caused by forcing individuals to undergo medical intervention cannot be offset by positive health outcomes, because it fundamentally interferes with the moral status of human biological vulnerability and the integrity of embodied agency. Furthermore, if any risk or harm were sufficient to justify coercion, then almost any activity that carries potential danger could be labeled a disaster, and consequently would grant authorities the right to override people’s freedoms. A consequence that could easily lead to unwanted or ethically unacceptable results. Therefore, individual freedoms cannot be restricted solely to prevent a potential disaster. 
This raises the crucial question: under what circumstances, if any, is it morally permissible to limit personal liberty?
Overriding Individual Freedoms
The above assumptions (A–C) also rely on a further assumption:
(D) that when authorities are granted the power to mandate vaccination, they will exercise this power in a just, professional, and public-spirited manner.
If authorities, like governments, are given the right to force people to get vaccinated then pharmaceutical companies may compete to control that power for their advantage. Politicians would have at least some motive to use their power to reward their allies at the expense of the public good.As Brennan notes, those who hold positions of power are real people, not “justice fairies” (Brennan, 2016). It is therefore reasonable to expect that regulatory capture and political self-interest may shape how such powers are exercised.

One might object that this concern is insufficient to reject mandatory vaccination, since vaccination programs appear to function relatively well in practice and government failures are relatively minor in this specific endeavor (Savulescu, 2020). For the sake of argument, I will grant assumption (D) as well. Even if governments exercise their authority in a benevolent and well-intentioned manner, significant ethical problems remain.

Flanigan offers an argument based on the claim that individuals do not have the right to impose deadly risks on others by remaining unvaccinated, just as they do not have the right to fire a rifle into the air (Flanigan, 2013). The underlying principle is that imposing serious and avoidable risk on others is sufficient to justify coercive restriction. However, it is not clear that the mere imposition of deadly risk, by itself, is enough to ground mandatory vaccination.

Consider the case of driving. Driving clearly imposes a substantial and foreseeable risk of serious harm to others. Traffic fatalities and injuries are not rare, and the risk is there even when individuals drive responsibly. Nevertheless, we generally judge that this risk is morally permissible, not because it is trivial, but because we still benefit greatly by living in a society where people are allowed to drive. This shows that the presence of serious risk, even risk of death, is not sufficient by itself to justify coercive prohibition.

It is important to note that this is necessarily a comparative judgment. Not all risks are equal, and restricting a liberty depends on the magnitude of the risk imposed. For this reason, one might argue that some vaccine mandates could be justified while others could not, depending on the specific disease, transmission rates, and available alternatives. I do not deny that such empirical differences matter. But even then, this would still not establish a general principle in favor of mandatory vaccination. At most, it would support a highly selective, case-by-case approach. The point of the analogy is therefore not that refusing vaccination and driving are identical in all morally relevant respects. Rather, it is to show that we already accept a social practice in which individuals are permitted to impose non-negligible risks on others when doing so is tied to important forms of agency, mobility, and participation in social life. 

But what would it actually take for overriding bodily autonomy to be morally justified? One way to sharpen this question is to adopt an account on which freedom is a necessary condition of a life worth living.

Justified Coercion
Kowalik argues that freedom is a necessary condition of a life worth living (Kowalik, 2021). On this view, restrictions on freedom are justified only when they are reasonably necessary to preserve what makes human life worth living. Applied to mandatory vaccination, this implies that proponents must establish at least three conditions:
The non-vaccination of X is both necessary and sufficient condition to increase the risk of harm to Y.
The risk of harm Y faces exceeds the risk of harm X faces associated with forced vaccination.
Correcting this imbalance is reasonably necessary to preserve what makes human life worth living.
A potential advantage to public health, by itself, does not establish these conditions. In particular, it does not automatically justify restrictions on bodily autonomy, which is itself a necessary condition of a life that is worth living. Moreover, individuals who are unable to be vaccinated often have alternative means of mitigating risk, other than vaccinating everyone else, such as protective measures and targeted precautions. This further calls into question the claim that mandatory vaccination is essential.
The burden therefore remains on proponents of mandatory vaccination to show that these conditions are met. Without such a demonstration, appeals to harm prevention and public health advantage are insufficient to justify coercive interference with individual bodily autonomy.
The question, then, is whether one can establish that non-vaccination itself constitutes a moral wrong sufficient to override individual freedom in the name of public health?
Herd Immunity and Free-Riders
Savulescu argues that achieving herd immunity is necessary for vaccines to be maximally effective, especially in protecting the most vulnerable in the population. To achieve herd immunity, a large majority of the population must be immune, which Savulescu estimates at approximately 82% (Savulescu, 2020).
One initial complication concerns the right of individuals to choose natural immunity over vaccine-induced immunity. Some individuals face minimal personal risk from COVID-19 and can make the case that they themselves are in no serious risk of dying from Covid and have a right to get infected. Moreover, immunity may be acquired without infection or vaccination, and while vaccination accelerates the achievement of herd immunity, it is not the only possible route. Thus, the claim that vaccination is the only morally acceptable means of contributing to herd immunity is not straightforwardly established.

Another point is related to the unequal distribution of harm. The associated risk of
vaccination is not being distributed equally, only the benefits of herd immunity does. The immunodeficient and medically vulnerable disproportionately reap the benefits, whereas vaccinated individuals assume the physical risks. Such an arrangement is ethically legitimate only if participation is voluntary. The moral force of collective benefit does not, by itself, justify compelling some individuals to bear risks for the sake of others. Without consent, this structure treats certain individuals as instruments for public health goals, rather than as agents with independent moral standing. 

This concern is not eliminated by appealing to expected benefits and expected harms. Even if, on average, the expected benefits of vaccination outweigh the expected harms, this does not address the moral problem of imposing serious risks on particular individuals for the sake of aggregate welfare. For some people, vaccination may involve negligible risk, while for others it may involve a small but real chance of severe or permanent harm. Forcing individuals to accept potentially life-altering risks in order to generate statistical benefits for others risks treating them as morally expendable. Kowalik’s point further strengthens this concern. He argues that immediate, direct harm carries greater moral weight than the probabilistic harm associated with individual vaccine refusal (Kowalik, 2021). This suggests that the moral significance of coercively imposing immediate bodily risk cannot be neutralized merely by pointing to diffuse, future-oriented public health benefits.

The appeal to herd immunity also relies on an implicit free-rider argument: that those who cannot be vaccinated unfairly benefit from the risks taken by others, and that this unfairness grounds a duty for everyone else to vaccinate.

Free riding is morally problematic when individuals intentionally exploit a cooperative scheme by refusing to bear their fair share of burdens while still claiming the benefits of others’ contributions. This structure does not apply to individuals who cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons. Such individuals are not opting out of cooperation; they are unable to participate. Their benefiting from herd immunity therefore does not constitute wrongful free riding.

The case of vaccine-nonresponsive individuals further complicates the argument. hese individuals may be fully willing to contribute and may in fact undergo vaccination, yet still fail to acquire immunity. And although they benefit from herd immunity, they do not in fact contribute to it. If moral entitlement to benefit is grounded in actual contribution, then these individuals would also lack entitlement, despite their willingness and compliance. 
As a result, only those who are effectively immunized would count as having contributed to herd immunity. But those individuals are precisely the ones who do not themselves benefit from herd immunity. This creates a dilemma: those who benefit have not contributed, and those who have contributed do not benefit. As a result, the attempt to ground a moral duty to vaccinate in entitlement to herd immunity becomes unstable.
This raises the question of whether coercive vaccination can ever be justified as reasonably necessary?
Innate Value of Human Beings
The ethical foundation of human existence rests on the principle that certain risks are intrinsic to human agency; exposing others to risk is not inherently unethical if that risk is a natural byproduct of living a life worth living. Central to this worth is bodily autonomy, a condition so fundamental to agency that it must be considered at least as valuable as life itself. 
This is best illustrated by the hypothetical case Kowalik (2021) proposed: Suppose a medical treatment exists which, if administered in infancy, prevents individuals from developing homosexuality in adulthood. Assume further that this treatment was developed in response to a unique and potentially lethal illness that disproportionately affects older homosexual individuals, and for which no reliable cure exists. The treatment would therefore significantly reduce mortality at the population level.
The question then is whether it would be ethically permissible to make such a treatment mandatory. If we take seriously the intrinsic characteristics of healthy human beings and the moral importance of self-constitution, the answer appears to be no. Even substantial public health benefits would not justify coercively altering fundamental aspects of personal identity. Parallel cases could be constructed involving other innate traits, such as gender or race, with the same moral implication.
For this reason, vaccine mandates are not the ethical analogous of seat belts as Savulescu claims, because wearing seatbelts does not alter someone’s individual constitution whereas vaccines does (Savulescu, 2020). Seatbelt laws regulate external behavior without altering an individual’s biological constitution. By contrast, vaccination is an irreversible medical intervention that changes internal biological processes. It therefore implicates bodily autonomy and self-constitution in a way that ordinary safety regulations do not.
The ethical concern, then, is not best understood as discrimination on the basis of vaccination status, but as treating ordinary biological vulnerability and immune variation as morally defective states in need of compulsory correction. This is the case even with a hypothetical 100% risk-free vaccine, because it effectively reframes ordinary human embodiment as deficient unless medically upgraded.
Formally, the argument can be stated as follows:
P: Mandatory vaccination constitutes a coercive legal measure designed to artificially enhance or alter the natural state of the human immune system.
R: The immune system’s natural state is an innate, healthy biological characteristic central to the constitution of all human beings.
S: Any mandate that penalizes an individual for maintaining an innate, healthy biological characteristic is a form of discrimination against their natural state.
From P–S, it follows that mandating vaccines is ethically impermissible, independently of any associated public health benefits. To deny this would imply that ordinary features of human biological embodiment are morally illegitimate unless medically optimized, a conclusion that conflicts with respect for persons as embodied agents.
